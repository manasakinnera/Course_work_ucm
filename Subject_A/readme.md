The code  is a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis
numpy: A library for scientific computing
matplotlib: A library for creating plots
nltk: A library for natural language processing
The code first imports the necessary libraries and then loads the VADER sentiment lexicon. The lexicon is a list of words and their associated sentiment scores. The scores range from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive).

Next, the code reads the tweets from a file. The tweets are stored in a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame contains the following columns:

tweet_id: The ID of the tweet
text: The text of the tweet
sentiment: The sentiment of the tweet (positive, negative, or neutral)
The code then uses the VADER sentiment lexicon to classify each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. The classification is based on the average sentiment score of the words in the tweet.

Finally, the code plots the distribution of sentiment scores for the tweets. The plot shows that the majority of the tweets are positive.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import nltk

Load the VADER sentiment lexicon
vader_lexicon = nltk.sentiment.vader_lexicon

Read the tweets from a file
tweets = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')

Add a column to the DataFrame for the sentiment of the tweet
tweets['sentiment'] = tweets['text'].apply(lambda text: vader_lexicon.polarity_scores(text)['compound'])

The program starts by defining a function called "percentage", which calculates the percentage of a part in relation to a whole. 
This function will be used later to calculate the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets in the dataset.
The program then uses Tweepy to retrieve the specified number of tweets that match the entered keyword or hashtag. A loop iterates
through each tweet and performs sentiment analysis using two libraries: TextBlob and SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
TextBlob is a library that provides a simple API for natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. It assigns a polarity
 score to each tweet, ranging from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive). The polarity score indicates the sentiment of the text.

SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is another library that provides a way to compute the sentiment score of a text. It provides a normalized 
score between -1 and 1 for negative, neutral, and positive sentiments, as well as a compound score that represents an overall sentiment score.
The program then classifies each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score computed by TextBlob and the sentiment
scores computed by SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. If the negative score is greater than the positive score, the tweet is classified as negative.
If the positive score is greater than the negative score, the tweet is classified as positive. If both scores are equal, the tweet is classified as neutral.
The program keeps track of the number of positive, negative, and neutral tweets in the dataset, and also stores the text of each tweet in a separate 
list based on its sentiment classification.
Finally, the program calculates the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets in the dataset using the "percentage" function defined earlier. 
It also calculates the overall polarity of the dataset by averaging the polarity scores of all the tweets. The results are printed out to the console
in the form of percentages.
Overall, this program is a simple implementation of sentiment analysis using two popular natural language processing libraries. It provides a basic 
understanding of how sentiment analysis works and can be used as a starting point for more complex applications.

Plot the distribution of sentiment scores for the tweets
plt.hist(tweets['sentiment'], bins=5)
plt.xlabel('Sentiment Score')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
